## About Me 

Hey there! I'm a Data and Business Intelligence Analyst with 2+ years of experience in analytics, forecasting, and leveraging data and BI tools to drive strategic business and product strategy decisions. 

In my previous roles, I’ve focused on automating and optimizing data workflows and building scalable analytics solutions that align with stakeholder goals across marketing, gameplay analytics, supply chain, and e-commerce consumer analytics.

### Skills and Education: 
I’m an ML and Data Science graduate from USC Viterbi (Fight On!), with a strong foundation in SQL, Python, R, statistical modeling, building machine learning and deep learning models, and designing data visualization dashboards(Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio). I also have experience with low-/no-code BI platforms such as Alteryx. 

My cloud experience spans AWS (S3, Glue, Redshift, Sagemaker, Forecast), Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Azure Data Factory. I've also been expanding my learning with generative AI and Large Language Models, including designing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows for contextual search, summarization, and insight discovery. This includes prompt engineering, embedding generation, vector search, and integrating LLM outputs into analytics workflows to automate reporting, data exploration, and stakeholder-facing insights.

I bring a product-first mindset to analytics, focusing on user behavior, core metrics, and experimentation to understand the 'why' behind the numbers and guide product decisions. I enjoy working cross-functionally in fast-paced environments, using data to shape product direction, improve user experiences, and drive measurable business impact.
